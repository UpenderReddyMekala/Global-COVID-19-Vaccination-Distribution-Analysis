## Objective
The objective of this analysis is to study the global distribution and progress of COVID-19 vaccinations across more than 130 countries. The project aims to uncover trends, identify disparities in vaccine distribution, and provide insights into how global efforts can be improved, particularly in regions where vaccination access is limited.

## Problem Statement
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on populations worldwide. Vaccination became a critical tool in controlling the spread of the virus. While many countries have made significant progress, others are facing challenges due to limited access, supply chain issues, and inadequate infrastructure. This project examines the reasons for the lag in vaccination distribution in certain regions and proposes solutions for improving global vaccine equity.

## Data Source
The data for this analysis was sourced from Skill-lync and includes vaccination data for more than 130 countries. The dataset provides detailed information on daily vaccinations, vaccine types, and the total number of vaccinations administered in each country.

## Data Cleaning
To ensure consistency in the analysis:
- Dates were standardized across records.
- Calculations were performed to determine total vaccinations per country and daily vaccination rates.

## Data Visualization
Power BI was used to visualize the key trends and insights derived from the data. The following visualizations were created:
- **Bar Charts**: To highlight the countries with the highest and lowest vaccination rates.
- **Geographical Map**: To display regional disparities in vaccination progress.

## Analysis & Insights

### Top Vaccinated Countries
A bar chart illustrates that countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, and Israel lead in vaccination rates. These countries benefit from better infrastructure, supply chains, and vaccine access.

### Lowest Vaccinated Countries
Another bar chart highlights countries in Africa and Southeast Asia with lower vaccination rates due to logistical challenges, limited vaccine supplies, and underdeveloped healthcare infrastructures.

### Geographical Trends
A world map visualization demonstrates the disparities in vaccination progress, with wealthier nations achieving higher coverage compared to developing nations.

### Insights
Richer countries are able to vaccinate their populations more quickly, while poorer countries face significant barriers to vaccine access and distribution. Issues with supply chains and healthcare infrastructure are contributing to these disparities.

## Recommendations
1. **Strengthen global vaccine supply chains** to support underserved regions.
2. **Promote international cooperation** to improve vaccine distribution equity.
3. **Invest in healthcare infrastructure** in developing nations to ensure a more efficient vaccine rollout.

## Conclusion
This analysis highlights significant disparities in vaccine distribution between wealthier and developing nations. Global coordination and collaboration are necessary to address these gaps and ensure equitable vaccine distribution. For global immunity to be achieved, these disparities must be mitigated to ensure that all countries have access to COVID-19 vaccines.
